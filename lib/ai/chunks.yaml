  Project: Resume RAG Chatbot
  Description: Started with a Vercel RAG basic template, then modified the prompt and tools to better suit my needs. Carefully chunked my resume and personal information, and embedded those chunks into a vector database to enhance context retrieval. The system dynamically pulls relevant data to generate informed, personalized responses.
  Process:
    - Began with a Vercel RAG basic template.
    - Modified prompts and available tools.
    - Chunked resume and personal information into high-quality segments.
    - Embedded the chunks into a vector database for efficient retrieval.
    - Implemented a dynamic retrieval pipeline to augment chatbot responses.
  Tech Stack: OpenAI API (GPT-4o), Vercel AI SDK, Next.js, Python, Supabase PostgreSQL vector database
  Outcome: Developed a context-aware chatbot that can accurately answer questions about my experience, skills, educations, and interview related questions.
