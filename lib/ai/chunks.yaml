  Personal Projects: Alec has developed two personal projects that complement each other: A portfolio website and RAG chatbot that can answer questions about Alec.
    Project: Resume RAG Chatbot
      Description: Started with a Vercel RAG basic template, then modified the prompt and tools to better suit my needs. Carefully chunked my resume and personal information, and embedded those chunks into a vector database to enhance context retrieval. The system dynamically pulls relevant data to generate informed, personalized responses.
      Alec followed this process to build the RAG chatbot:
        Step 1 Began with a Vercel RAG basic template.
        Step 2 Modified prompts and available tools.
        Step 3 Chunked resume and personal information into high-quality segments.
        Step 4 Embedded the chunks into a vector database for efficient retrieval.
        Step 5 Implemented a dynamic retrieval pipeline to augment chatbot responses.
        Step 6 Testing and Refinement
      To develop the chatbot, Alec used this tech Stack: OpenAI API (GPT-4o), Vercel AI SDK, Next.js, Python, Supabase PostgreSQL vector database.
      The project outcome is a context-aware chatbot that can accurately answer questions about my experience, skills, educations, and interview related questions.
    Project: Personal Portfolio Website
      Tech Stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Three.js, Vercel.
      Description: Developed a dynamic portfolio website that showcases my technical skills and projects. The site features visual Skill Icons representing various programming languages and developer tools, an immersive Gen AI 3D model generated from my graduation photo (enhanced with 3D assets from Sketchfab), smooth animations and interactive effects using framer-motion and Three.js, a seamless email contact form powered by react-hook-form, and integrated GitHub Stats API to highlight my contributions.
      Key Features:
        - Engaging Animations & Effects: Implements smooth transitions and interactive elements with Three.js and framer-motion.
        - GitHub Stats API: Dynamically showcases my GitHub contributions.
        - Skill Icons: Displays visual representations of key programming languages and developer tools.
        - Gen AI 3D Model: Utilizes meshy.ai and Sketchfab assets to find and create a unique 3D model from my graduation photo.
        - Email Contact Form: Offers a user-friendly way to contact me using react-hook-form.
      Outcome: This project not only highlights my proficiency with modern web technologies but also demonstrates my ability to blend creative design with technical functionality, making it a standout piece in my portfolio for innovative tech roles.
